## Types of Malware (Based on Infection and Attack)

### 1. **Trojan**
- A Trojan disguises itself as a legitimate program but takes control of your computer.
- Trojans do **not** replicate themselves.

**Common types of Trojans:**
- **Backdoor Trojan**: Grants attackers remote access to your computer.
- **Mail Finder Trojan**: Steals email addresses.
- **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**: Gives full control of your system via remote network access.
- **Trojan Banker**: Targets financial information and online banking credentials.

---

### 2. **Worm**
- A self-replicating program that spreads through local area networks without user interaction.

---

### 3. **Virus**
- Infects files or programs, corrupts or deletes data.
- Capable of replication.

**Common signs of virus infection:**
- System slowdown
- Pop-up windows
- Programs executing by themselves
- Unexpected logouts
- System crashes

**Types of viruses:**
- **Resident Virus**: Needs a host file to function.
- **Non-Resident Virus**: Can execute and spread without a host.
- **Browser Hijacker**: Changes browser settings without user permission.

---

### 4. **Ransomware**
- Encrypts files or systems and demands ransom for decryption.
- Commonly targets databases and servers.

---

### 5. **Rootkit**
- Allows attackers to gain unauthorized root (admin) access.
- Used to maintain persistent, hidden control of a system.

---

### 6. **Adware**
- Displays unwanted advertisements on your device.

---

### 7. **Botnet**
- A network of compromised devices ("bots") controlled remotely by an attacker.

---

## Infection Techniques

- USB drop attack  
- Spam or phishing emails  
- Malicious Office macros  
- Cracked or pirated software  
- Malicious browser extensions  

---

## Malware Detection and Prevention

### 1. **Signature-Based Detection**
- Compares files to a database of known malware signatures.
- Example tool: [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)

### 2. **Behavior-Based Detection**
- Analyzes the behavior of a program to identify suspicious activities.
- May result in **false positives**.

### 3. **Sandboxing**
- Runs programs in a controlled, isolated environment to observe behavior safely.

---

## Antivirus Evasion Techniques

### 1. **Packers**
- Compress executables to hide their contents and reduce size.

### 2. **Cryptors**
- Encrypt malicious files to avoid detection.

### 3. **Polymorphic Malware**
- Continuously changes its code with each infection to evade signature detection.

### 4. **Downloaders and Droppers**
- Initial files that download or "drop" additional malware onto the system.

### 5. **Fileless Malware**
- Operates entirely in memory, leaving no trace on the hard drive.
