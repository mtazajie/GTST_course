- **Grey Hat:** Mix of both—may hack without permission but expose vulnerabilities.
    
- **Script Kiddies:** Use pre-made tools with little understanding.
    
- **Pro Hackers:** Highly skilled with deep system knowledge.
    

#### **4. Why Learn Cybersecurity?**

- **Prevent Breaches:** Stop hackers from accessing sensitive data.
    
- **Protect Privacy:** Safeguard personal/organizational information.
