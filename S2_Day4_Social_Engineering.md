S2Day4: Social Engineering

**Social engineering** is the act of manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Instead of hacking computers directly, social engineers exploit human psychology to gain unauthorized access.

## Steps of Social Engineering Attack

1. **Research**  
   Collect detailed information about the target (individual or organization) to identify weaknesses and potential entry points. This may include gathering data from social media, websites, or other public sources.

2. **Hook**  
   Establish trust or rapport with the target by impersonating a legitimate entity or creating believable scenarios. The goal is to lower the target's guard.

3. **Play**  
   Exploit the trust gained during the hook phase to extract sensitive information, deliver malware, or persuade the target to perform actions that compromise security.

4. **Exit**  
   Conclude the attack carefully, often by covering tracks or disengaging without raising suspicion to avoid detection.

## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

1. **Phishing**  
   Fraudulent emails, messages, or websites designed to trick victims into providing sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details. These messages often appear to come from trusted companies or contacts.

2. **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**  
   Using phone calls to deceive victims into revealing confidential information, such as bank details or login credentials.

3. **Shoulder Surfing**  
   Observing someoneâ€™s private information by looking over their shoulder, such as watching them type a password or PIN.

4. **Dumpster Diving**  
   Searching through trash bins or recycling containers to find discarded documents or data that can be used to compromise security.

5. **Pretexting**  
   Creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to manipulate the victim into divulging information or granting access, often by pretending to be someone in authority or a trusted entity.

6. **Baiting**  
   Offering something enticing (like free software or a gift) to lure victims into compromising their security, often through infected USB drives or malicious downloads.

7. **Scareware**  
   Displaying fake security alerts or warnings to frighten users into downloading malware or revealing personal information.

8. **Tailgating / Piggybacking**  
   An unauthorized person physically following an authorized individual into a secure area by closely following them without proper credentials.

9. **Eavesdropping**  
   Intercepting private communications, whether verbal (listening to conversations) or electronic (wiretapping or packet sniffing).

## Prevention Methods

1. **Employee Awareness and Training**  
   Regular training to recognize social engineering tactics and understand security policies.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   Using multiple verification steps to confirm identity, making it harder for attackers to gain access with stolen credentials.

3. **Strong Password Policies**  
   Enforcing complex passwords, regular changes, and avoiding password reuse.

4. **Physical Security Measures**  
   Prevent unauthorized access to facilities with badges, guards, and secure entry points.

5. **Regular Security Audits**  
   Testing employees and systems for vulnerabilities to social engineering.

## Social Media Hacking

While hacking companies directly can be difficult, attackers often target individual users through social media platforms. Personal accounts often contain valuable information that can be exploited for further attacks.

## Tools for Social Engineering

- **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**  
  A popular open-source framework designed to perform advanced social engineering attacks.  
  *Note:* SET requires the attacker and the target to be on the same Local Area Network (LAN) for some of its features.

## Automation Tools and Hacking Scenarios

- **Telegram Hacking Scenarios**  
  Attackers may use Telegram bots to automate phishing attacks, such as:  
  - **OTP Bots:** Automated bots that trick victims into sharing one-time passwords (OTPs) sent to their phones.  
  - **Telegram Bot-Based Phishing:** Bots impersonate trusted services to lure users into revealing sensitive data.
