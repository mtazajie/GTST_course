## 🌐 Networking Fundamentals 

### 📌 What is a Network?

A **network** allows computers and devices to communicate and share data. The main goal is to **transfer information** efficiently between systems.

### 🧱 Network Components

* **Ethernet Cable** – Connects devices in a wired local network.
* **Wall Jack** – Physical port to connect a device to the infrastructure.
* **Switch** – Connects multiple devices in a LAN, enabling communication.
* **Router** – Connects different networks and directs data packets between them.
* **Firewall** – Protects against unauthorized access and blocks malicious traffic.
* **Modem** – Connects a home/small network to the internet.
* **Wireless Access Point (WAP)** – Enables wireless connectivity.
* **Servers** – Provide resources or services to clients (e.g., game or web servers).

### 🕸️ Types of Networks

* **LAN (Local Area Network)** – Covers a small area (e.g., home, office).
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – Connects LANs over a large geographic area.
* **Internet** – A global network made up of many interconnected routers and networks.

### 🛆 Data Transmission

* Data is transmitted as **packets**.
* **Routers** determine the best path and forward packets between networks.
* The internet = a network of routers.
* Packet routes may vary dynamically.

### 🦠 Network Evolution

1. **Direct connections** via crossover cables (early days).
2. **Switches** introduced to connect multiple devices.
3. **Routers** added to connect different networks.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Internetworking** – Connecting multiple networks for broader communication.
* **Broadcast Domain** – Area where broadcast traffic is propagated.
* **MAC Address** – Unique hardware ID for network interfaces.
* **VLAN (Virtual LAN)** – Logical grouping of devices, regardless of physical location.

---

### 🔒 Network Security

* **Firewalls** are critical for protection from threats.
* **Hackers** attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.
* Firewalls **filter traffic**, blocking attacks and allowing legitimate communication.

### 🏅 CCNA Certification

* Validates knowledge of **switching, routing, and security**.
* Prepares for a career in **network engineering**.
* A strong foundation for advanced certifications and job opportunities.
