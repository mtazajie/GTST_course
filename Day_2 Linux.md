#### **1. Introduction to Linux**

- Linux is a kernel, which acts as a bridge between software and hardware, managing resources like CPU, memory, and devices.
    
- Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, Linux is open-source and written in C.
    

#### **2. History of Linux**

- UNIX, created in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, was proprietary.
    
- Richard Stallman initiated the GNU project in 1983 to create a free UNIX-like OS.
    
- Linux combined with GNU tools formed the GNU/Linux OS.
    

#### **3. Shell and Types**

- A **shell** is a command-line interpreter that communicates user commands to the kernel.
    
- Common shells:
    
    - **SH**: Basic shell.
        
    - **BASH**: Default for many systems, feature-rich.
        
    - **ZSH**: Advanced with better scripting and UI.
        
    - **FISH**: User-friendly with auto-suggestions.
        
- Check your shell with `echo $SHELL`.
    

#### **4. Operating System (OS)**

- An OS includes:
    
    - Kernel
        
    - Software
        
    - Desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE)
        
    - File system
        
    - Window manager (e.g., i3)
        

#### **5. Linux Distributions (Distros)**

- Modified Linux kernels with different:
    
    - Kernels
        
    - Packages (GNU tools)
        
    - Package managers (e.g., `apt`, `pacman`)
        
    - Desktop UIs
        
- Popular distros:
    
    - **Beginner-friendly**: Ubuntu, Mint.
        
    - **Intermediate**: Fedora, OpenSUSE.
        
    - **Advanced**: Arch, Gentoo.
        
    - **Security-focused**: Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Black Arch.
        

#### **6. Why Use Linux?**

- Lightweight: Runs on low-spec hardware.
    
- Dominant in:
    
    - Servers (96.3% of top web servers).
        
    - Supercomputers (100% of top 500).
        
    - Smartphones (85% via Android).
        
- Secure and privacy-focused.
    
- Preferred for hacking/penetration testing tools.
    

#### **7. How to Use Linux**

- **Main OS**: Best performance but no dual-boot.
    
- **Dual Boot**: Share disk with another OS (e.g., Windows).
    
- **Live Boot**: Run from USB/DVD without installation.
    
- **Cloud Terminals**: Access via web (e.g., Webminal).
    
- **Virtual Machine (VM)**:
    
    - Type 1: Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi).
        
    - Type 2: Runs on a host OS (e.g., VirtualBox).
        
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: Run Linux on Windows.
    
- **Termux**: Lightweight Linux environment for Android.
